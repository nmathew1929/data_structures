IntList
    A primitive linked-list implementation
        that keeps track of an int value and the next node.
    has get() and size()
    
    pros 
        can add more integers dynamically.
    cons
        clunky to use
        the client has to directly deal with pointers.
        having a naked recursive data structure is strange. (atleast in java)
        inorder to effectively write code they need to know how references work, in a pretty deep way. The recursion is right there for everyone to see.
